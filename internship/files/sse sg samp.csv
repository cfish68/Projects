International Conference o,"Imagine that you take a ride in a bus in London or Vienna. Across from you sits a man who obviously is not well. He coughs a lot. Perhaps he has tuberculosis, and if so, he may infect you with his coughs, spits and sneezes. He does so by belching at you myriads of tiny airborne droplets, not much bigger in size than the bacteria they carry. When you inhale the droplets, a single bacterium, called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, can infect you. Your innate immune system may protect you from the bacterium, and we do not know how often it does. But if the bacterium takes hold and establishes a productive infection, you are part of the one quarter of the worlds population that is infected with tuberculosis. Open tuberculosis is treated by medication, but the treatment is not pleasant. You have to take antibiotics for six to nine months, and the side effects may induce you to not complete the treatment. That, of course, endangers the people around you as well. Even if you are a compliant patient, you may be unlucky, and you do not respond to the commonly used antibiotic treatmentthat is, you have multidrug resistant tuberculosis. That places you among the five percent of patients with a similar condition, with 480,000 cases and 190,000 deaths each year. Now your treatment may take eighteen to twenty four months to complete, and the average cure rate is 50 percent. (A new treatment schedule may be completed in nine to twelve months, and will cost less, only $1,000). Dr. Wabl was a co-founder of Sagres Discovery, Inc.
